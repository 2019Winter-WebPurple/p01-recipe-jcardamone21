                <!-- This is an unordered list of the ingredients -->
                    <li>2¼ cups oat flour</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons packed cocnut sugar or brown sugar</li>

                    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup milk of choice</li>
                    <li>Scant ½ cup melted coconut oil or 7½ tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                    <li>¾ cup mashed ripe bananas, about 2 medium</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

            <b>Instructions!</b>
                <ol><!-- This is an ordered list of the instructions -->
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the oat flour, sugar, starch, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk to combine.</li>
                    <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the eggs. Then add the milk, coconut oil or butter, mashed banana and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is throughly blended.</li>
                    <li>Pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture. Stir with a big spoon until combined (the batter will have a few lumps). Let the batter rest for 10 minutes so the oat flour has time to soak up some of the moisture. Plug in your waffle iron to preheat now.</li>
                    <li>Once ten minutes is up, give the batter one more, gentle swirl with your spoon. The batter will be pretty thick. Using a measuring cup, pour batter onto the heated waffle iron, enough to cover the center and most of the central surface area, and close the lid.</li>
                    <li>Wait to check on the waffles until most of the steam has stopped billowing out the sides (this takes about 5-6 minutes). Once the waffle is deeply golden and crisp, transfer it to a cooling rack or baking sheet. Don't stack your waffles on top of each other, or they'll lose crispness.</li>
                    <li>If desired, keep your waffles warm by placing them in a 200 degree oven until you're ready to serve. Repeat with remaining batter and serve with desired toppings.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
